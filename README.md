# PipeNetworkHighlighter

This mod adds an overlay to Factorio that helps to show pipe system connectivity.

Default toggle hotkey is LSHIFT.

###### TODO
[x] Add toggle hotkey.
[ ] Extend support to anything a pipe can connect to.

###### Changelog

v0.1.0 - Initial commit. Supports pipes, pipe-to-grounds, and basic pump support.
